# Movie-Reviews---Sentiment_Analysis
Predicting whether the movie is good or bad based on the user's review about the movie

Movie reviews are a crucial aspect of sensitizing an audience towards a movie. They provide people with multiple perspectives and allow people to decide whether to watch a movie. Movie reviews are far more personalized than statistical ratings or scores. They embody the opinion of the reviewer, and are highly subjective in nature. A crucial characteristic of the reviews is their sentiment, or overall opinion towards the subject matter. As such, sentiment analysis is performed to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study the reviews.

Sentences in reviews contain independent clauses that express different sentiments toward different aspects of a movie. Labelling these articles with their sentiment would provide succinct summaries to readers. The research paper implemented examines the effectiveness of applying machine learning techniques to the sentiment classification problem. The method adopts a classifier approach of computing the sentiment of a clause from the prior sentiment scores assigned to individual words, taking into consideration the grammatical dependency structure of the clause, and delicately handling negative phrases.
